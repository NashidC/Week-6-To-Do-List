# Week-6-To-Do-List

This is my to-do list app. You type in what task you want to add and then click add. If you click on your task it will turn blue and get crossed out as it is "completed". You can also delete items from the list one by one by clicking the "x" or you can clear all the items by clicking "clear items"
